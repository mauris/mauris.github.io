As you build up your React application, you will find yourself facing some of these scenarios:\n\n- you have queries that execute depending on the data returned from an earlier query: you can run conditional queries like in the guide on [Dependent Queries](https://react-query.tanstack.com/guides/dependent-queries).\n- you have queries that can run in parallel: [`useQueries()`](https://react-query.tanstack.com/guides/parallel-queries) is there to solve parallel queries\n- you have the same query that will be requested by multiple components in the same render cycle: It's more favourable to request for the same query multiple times than to perform [props drilling](https://blogs.perficient.com/2021/12/03/understanding-react-context-and-property-prop-drilling/), as you can configure [`staleTime`](https://react-query.tanstack.com/guides/important-defaults) to your needs\n\nTkDodo has written about [creating custom hooks](https://tkdodo.eu/blog/practical-react-query#create-custom-hooks). Using custom hooks makes reading a component's code a breeze, because `useQuery` and how data is fetched gets colocated together in a custom hook. For example, a custom hook to fetch the list of todo items:\n\n```typescript\nexport const useTodoListQuery = (filter: Filter = {}) =>\n  useQuery([\"todos\", filter], () => fetchTodoList(filter));\n```\n\nAs I encountered more of those scenarios I described earlier, I found the need to reuse queries written in `useQuery` to also be used in `useQueries` for parallel execution. To make things more manageable, I decided to write utility function for constructing query options:\n\n```typescript\nexport const buildTodoListQueryOptions = (filter: Filter) => ({\n  queryKey: [\"todos\", filter],\n  queryFn: () => fetchTodoList(filter),\n});\n\nexport const useTodoListQuery = (filter: Filter = {}) =>\n  useQuery(buildTodoListQueryOptions(filter));\n```\n\nIn the event that I need to build a portion of User Interface that needed to run the `useTodoListQuery` in parallel with something else, say loading calendar items, I can do this:\n\n```typescript\nexport const buildTodoListQueryOptions = (filter: Filter) => ({\n  // ...\n});\n\nexport const useTodoListQuery = // ...\n\nexport const buildCalendarItemsQueryOptions = (dateRange: DateRange) => ({\n  queryKey: [\"calendar\", dateRange],\n  queryFn: () => fetchCalendarItems(dateRange),\n});\n\nexport const useCalendarItemsQuery = // ...\n\nexport const useLandingInfoQuery = (\n  dateRange: DateRange,\n  filter: Filter = {}\n) =>\n  useQueries([\n    buildCalendarItemsQueryOptions(dateRange),\n    buildTodoListQueryOptions(filter),\n  ]);\n```\n\nThis makes it easier to build composable queries. That said, I don't think everyone should start going around and pick out their query options from whereever `useQuery` appeared. The abstraction should only occur when there is a good enough reason to do so, like when a particular query needs to be used in multiple instances of `useQuery` and `useQueries` to enhance user experience and loading time.\n\nWhat do you think?\n","prevId":"2022-04-11-giscus-blog-comments-github-discussions"},"prevPost":{"id":"2022-04-11-giscus-blog-comments-github-discussions","meta":{"title":"Giscus: Blog Comments with GitHub Discussions","date":"2022-04-11","coverImage":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1648819955157-a9a96e307d56?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&q=80&fm=jpg&crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&dl=siarhei-palishchuk-um_LMDP8pSY-unsplash.jpg&w=1920","coverImageCaption":"Photo by [Siarhei Palishchuk](https://unsplash.com/@smeshny) on Unsplash","tags":["utterances","giscus"]},"content":"\nLast week, I integrated [Utterances](https://utteranc.es) to my blog over a couple of hours and shortly after integration, I found out about [Giscus](https://giscus.app/) and [laymonage](https://github.com/laymonage) came over to tell me that Giscus comes \"with a ready-to-use [component library](https://github.com/giscus/giscus-component)\".\n\nBeing \"heavily inspired by utterances\", Giscus is similar in many aspects (client-side integration, custom themes, reactions etc.) leveraged on [GitHub Discussions](https://docs.github.com/en/discussions) to host comments rather than GitHub Issues. Since I was familiar with how Utterances worked by then, I was able to quickly switch over to Giscus in an hour or so. Additionally, Giscus allows you to:\n\n- add reactions to the page itself - these are stored on the discussion original post and can be disabled by option\n- replies to comments, nesting - this is a feature I understand to be not supported by GitHub Issues\n- sorting of comments by oldest/newest\n- configuring if the comment box should be placed above all comments - I preferred not to scroll through the long list of comments before adding my comment, though this is purely the user's preference.\n\nOne thing I was facinated about, was that the comments widget did not reload fully when themes changed. I dug into the component library's source code and found that Giscus's component library leverages on [message passing to the iframe](https://github.com/giscus/giscus-component/blob/main/web/src/giscus.ts#L202) to update changes occurred in the component props. When using Utterances, any change in the props would result in a full reload of the script and iframe.\n\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mauris/site-content/main/assets/d3c0caadbf.gif\" />\n\nGiscus worked nicely, and I guess it's here to stay on my blog. Kudos to the Giscus team for building on the goodness that Utterances brought about.\n","nextId":"2022-05-08-react-query-options","prevId":"2022-04-05-utterances-blog-comments"}},"__N_SSG":true}
