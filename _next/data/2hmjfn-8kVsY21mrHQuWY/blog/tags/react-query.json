As you build up your React application, you will find yourself facing some of these scenarios:\n\n- you have queries that execute depending on the data returned from an earlier query: you can run conditional queries like in the guide on [Dependent Queries](https://react-query.tanstack.com/guides/dependent-queries).\n- you have queries that can run in parallel: [`useQueries()`](https://react-query.tanstack.com/guides/parallel-queries) is there to solve parallel queries\n- you have the same query that will be requested by multiple components in the same render cycle: It's more favourable to request for the same query multiple times than to perform [props drilling](https://blogs.perficient.com/2021/12/03/understanding-react-context-and-property-prop-drilling/), as you can configure [`staleTime`](https://react-query.tanstack.com/guides/important-defaults) to your needs\n\nTkDodo has written about [creating custom hooks](https://tkdodo.eu/blog/practical-react-query#create-custom-hooks). Using custom hooks makes reading a component's code a breeze, because `useQuery` and how data is fetched gets colocated together in a custom hook. For example, a custom hook to fetch the list of todo items:\n\n```typescript\nexport const useTodoListQuery = (filter: Filter = {}) =>\n  useQuery([\"todos\", filter], () => fetchTodoList(filter));\n```\n\nAs I encountered more of those scenarios I described earlier, I found the need to reuse queries written in `useQuery` to also be used in `useQueries` for parallel execution. To make things more manageable, I decided to write utility function for constructing query options:\n\n```typescript\nexport const buildTodoListQueryOptions = (filter: Filter) => ({\n  queryKey: [\"todos\", filter],\n  queryFn: () => fetchTodoList(filter),\n});\n\nexport const useTodoListQuery = (filter: Filter = {}) =>\n  useQuery(buildTodoListQueryOptions(filter));\n```\n\nIn the event that I need to build a portion of User Interface that needed to run the `useTodoListQuery` in parallel with something else, say loading calendar items, I can do this:\n\n```typescript\nexport const buildTodoListQueryOptions = (filter: Filter) => ({\n  // ...\n});\n\nexport const useTodoListQuery = // ...\n\nexport const buildCalendarItemsQueryOptions = (dateRange: DateRange) => ({\n  queryKey: [\"calendar\", dateRange],\n  queryFn: () => fetchCalendarItems(dateRange),\n});\n\nexport const useCalendarItemsQuery = // ...\n\nexport const useLandingInfoQuery = (\n  dateRange: DateRange,\n  filter: Filter = {}\n) =>\n  useQueries([\n    buildCalendarItemsQueryOptions(dateRange),\n    buildTodoListQueryOptions(filter),\n  ]);\n```\n\nThis makes it easier to build composable queries. That said, I don't think everyone should start going around and pick out their query options from whereever `useQuery` appeared. The abstraction should only occur when there is a good enough reason to do so, like when a particular query needs to be used in multiple instances of `useQuery` and `useQueries` to enhance user experience and loading time.\n\nWhat do you think?\n","nextId":"2022-05-12-backend-power-on-self-test","prevId":"2022-04-11-giscus-blog-comments-github-discussions"}],"tag":"react-query"},"__N_SSG":true}
